Taco Parser
Welcome to the Taco Parser project! ðŸŒ® This project focuses on parsing location data to determine the two Taco Bell locations that are farthest apart based on their longitude and latitude coordinates.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to:

Parse location data to extract longitude and latitude information of Taco Bell locations.
Calculate the distance between all pairs of Taco Bell locations using their coordinates.
Identify the two Taco Bell locations that are farthest apart based on their geographical distance.
Features:
Data Parsing: Utilizes data parsing techniques to extract location information from input files or APIs.

Distance Calculation: Implements algorithms to compute geographical distances between pairs of locations.

Output: Provides output that identifies the two Taco Bell locations that are farthest apart.
